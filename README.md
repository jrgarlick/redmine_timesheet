# Redmine Timesheet Summary Plugin

This is a very simple Redmine plugin that shows you a summary of the time entries made over the day. The global plugin groups all your time entries for a day, collecting them into a nice summary view that you can use for whatever you like. We used the plugin to summarize our activities in other tracking systems.

The plugin adds a 'My Timesheet' link at the global menu at the top of the page. Once in the app, there is a list of upto 10 days of timesheets.
